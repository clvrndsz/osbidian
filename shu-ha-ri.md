Shu-Ha-Ri is a martial arts concept that's been adapted to various fields, including business, education, and personal development.

It refers to the stages of learning and mastery: Shu (follow the rules), Ha (break the rules), and Ri (create your own rules).

Shu-Ha-Ri emphasises the importance of following tradition and learning from others, before developing one's own style or approach.
