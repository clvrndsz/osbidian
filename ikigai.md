_What's your purpose?_

Ikigai translates to "reason for being" or "purpose in life."

The reason you wake up each morning.

It's the intersection of what you love, what you are good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for.

By identifying your ikigai, you can find a sense of meaning and direction in your life.

How to apply ikigai to your life:

Start by reflecting on your passions, strengths, values, and the needs of the world around you.

Consider what brings you joy and fulfillment, and how you can use your talents and skills to make a positive impact.

By finding the sweet spot where your passions, skills, and values intersect, you can discover your ikigai and live a more purposeful life.
