I think i Might have figured out the hibernate feature on mint btw. 

Set tlp to deep sleep on battery.
set swapfile to priority 1
resize swap file by checking how much you need for the swap. i needed 3.2 i had 2 hence it failed all the time.
This is so cool. 
This should  be the most persistent way to get hibernate working on the OS.


Bro, my battery died while i left the computer alone on standby/suspend; the laptop went into hibernate and restarted when i plugged power back in when I asked it to reboot. IT RESUMED ANYWAY>
